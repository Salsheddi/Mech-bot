        "question": "Great Wall V240: Engine won't start",
        "answer": "A car that is reluctant to start first thing in the morning but then starts fine after that initial start-up could be a victim of worn engine internals. Specifically, if the valve guides or piston rings are worn enough, the engine may not have sufficient compression to fire up from dead cold. That fact that the engine got very hot at some stage is also a good way to damage things like piston rings and lead to the symptoms you’re describing. Pull-starting with, I presume, another vehicle can spin the engine faster than a starter-motor will, and for longer, and this could be enough to give the engine the encouragement it needs to fire up for the first time. Is the engine burning oil? Or blowing blue smoke? Both are signs of a worn out engine.Other possible causes are many and varied and include incorrect ignition timing, out-of-phase valve timing, poor fuel pressure, the cold-start enrichment mechanism not working or a range of sensors not playing the game. And plenty more.If your car was a V200, then I’d suggest that the diesel engine’s glow-plugs had failed, but the V240 was petrol only. But that in itself is interesting because the engine was more or less an older-design Mitsubishi built under license by Great Wall. As such, it’s a fairly simple old thing with not too much to go wrong.Perhaps there’s a clue in the fact that the doors lock themselves as soon as you’re on board. Maybe this has something to do with the body computer (that controls functions such as the central locking and immobiliser) which should perhaps be talking to the engine computer, but isn’t first thing in the morning. Do changes in the ambient temperature change the car’s habits? Is it harder to start on wet days? Is the tank full of very old fuel? All these things can have an effect on a motor that is a bit cantankerous to begin with."

        "question": "Mercedes-Benz GLC200 and GLC300: Are the Australian engines mild-hybrids?",
        "answer": "You’ve hit the nail on the head Alan. The 48-volt mild-hybrids weren’t taken up by M-B Australia, purely because the plug-in hybrid GLC300e will have a bigger battery than before (for more range) and is a better fit with where the brand is going in this country. Watch out for the plug-in GLC in showrooms in the second quarter of this year."

        "answer": "I contacted Renault Australia about this, Trevor. But it seems they need to know the trim level and precise model before they can offer an answer. Apparently, different specifications across the Koleos range meant that some variants had a different clock in a different dashboard which required a different technique to reset. Have you asked at a dealership?"

        "answer": "If your car was built between August 6 and October 30, 2010, Wayne, then it was the subject of a Nissan recall that was announced in November 2011. Apparently, the power-steering’s assistance could simply stop working, meaning that the steering would still work, but would require a lot more muscle input form the driver. Check the dashboard for a power-steering warning light that is the other clue that this is what’s happening.The fact that your car’s problem is intermittent is a bit confusing, but given its recall history, I reckon a visit to a Nissan dealership to see whether the car was one of the affected ones is worth the effort. The other possibility is that the car needs a wheel-alignment as the wheels are not pointing where they should be when you’re turning right."

        "question": "What cars with high seats and a big boot do you recommend?",
        "answer": "If your dad was happy with his previous Yaris, then I think the new model would suit him just as well. Don’t be put off by the lack of a sedan, as the hatchback version is actually even better at swallowing things like wheelchairs. You’d be amazed at just how practical a conventional hatchback is. The real shame is that Toyota no longer sells the three-door version of the Yaris (they’re all five-doors now). Because the three-door model had longer doors, they made getting and in and out even easier. The only catch was that they opened pretty wide (which is why disabled car-parking spaces are extra wide as well)."

        "answer": "None of the vehicles you’ve listed are exactly low-maintenance units. They all have complex all-wheel-drive drivelines (which will be appreciated when towing a heavy trailer across a wet showground) and they use the latest common-rail diesel technology which is fairly intolerant of poor servicing.As for a power tailgate on a ute, I’m afraid you’re out of luck. But some of the wagon versions of these vehicles can be optioned with powered tailgates. The catch there is that these vehicles use coil sprung rear axles (as opposed to the leaf-sprung ute versions) so they’re not as adept at towing. The Toyota Fortuner, for instance can’t match the HiLux’s 3.5-tonne limit and makes do with 2800kg; not enough for your requirements. The Ford Everest (based on the Ranger) is a little better at 3000kg, but still trails the Ranger’s 3500kg towing capacity and is right on your self-imposed minimum."

        "answer": "This is another of those \"get the vehicle scanned\" situations. There are about a thousand things that can cause an engine to stop in its tracks the way you’ve described, and only by scanning the computer to see what fault codes have been logged can you even begin to make a diagnosis. You cold be looking at anything from a crank-angle sensor, to a blocked fuel-tank breather, or a faulty throttle-position sensor to damaged coil-pack. Or anything in between. Modern engines are complicated beasts and the days of checking for spark, fuel and compression as a simple roadside diagnosis are long gone.By the way, you haven’t told me whether you have the four-cylinder or V6 versions of the Tuscon. Without that information, I’m flying even blinder."

        "question": "Volkswagen Golf 2016 or Hyundai i30 2018: Are they reliable?",
        "answer": "A Golf with that mileage after just three or four years on the road is a bit of an anomaly. How has the car been used? Was it a delivery vehicle in a previous life? I’d be asking some tough questions and diving deep into the vehicle’s service history to find out how it’s been driven and serviced before taking the plunge, because that mileage is about double what I’d expect from this make and model.The biggest potential reliability glitch with this car is the DSG transmission. While VW claimed that all the evils were fixed by the time the Golf 7 came out in 2013, experience suggests that there are still some examples of this gearbox giving trouble. Symptoms include a loss of drive, poor shift quality, shuddering on take-off and a gearbox that seemingly loses the plot on occasions.And I’m afraid your alternative rings a few alarm bells as well. The Hyundai also uses a double-clutch style transmission and while it hasn’t suffered the litany of problems that the VW unit has caused over the years, it’s still a bit of an unknown quantity. Certainly, some customers seem to be unhappy with the unit in terms of its longevity and replacement clutch packs are not unknown.Also, you seem to have a knack for finding cars with double the expected kilometres on board. I’d expect a 2018 i30 to be showing closer to 25,000km than the 50,000km on the one you’re considering. Cars with higher than expected mileage can be bargains, but you’ve really got to dig into their past to ensure they haven’t been abused or suffered from poor servicing."

        "question": "Holden Cruze 2013 or 2010: Are they worth buying?",
        "answer": "The big difference between the two Cruzes you’ve nominated is that the earlier car was built in South Korea while, from 2011 on, production moved to Holden’s Australian production facility in Adelaide where it was built alongside the Commodore. There’s a school of thought that suggests the locally-made versions would be of better build quality than the Daewoo-made version, but in reality, there’s not much in it.That said, we’d go for the later, Australian-made car, as these had a much better range of engines from which to choose. Specifically, the locally-made Cruze could be had with a 1.4 or 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine either of which was smooth and pretty zingy. Or, you could opt for the two-litre turbo-diesel or the non-turbo 1.8-litre petrol as seen in the early, imported Cruze.The diesel is very frugal and offers a relaxed driving experience, but the two turbo-petrol engines are the pick of the crop for smoothness and performance. The one to avoid? The non-turbo 1.8. It was breathless, noisy and generally unpleasant."

        "question": "Audi A3 and A4 2010: Are they reliable?",
        "answer": "Volkswagen is very quick to point out that the earlier transmission woes with its DSG gearbox have been fixed. Certainly, the later versions seem to be better, but the jury is still out on whether the fix has been a complete one.In any case, that’s no use to you as the cars made around 2010 are, indeed, the ones that were most affected by these troublesome transmissions. The smaller Audi models were the main offenders as some of those used the dry-clutch version of the DSG. The larger (and heavier) A4 tended to have the wet-clutch version of the same gearbox which wasn’t nearly as problematic. So that should be your golden rule here if you decide to take the plunge: Only buy a second-hand Audi with a wet-clutch DSG. Even then, we can’t guarantee that it will be all sweetness and light, but at least you’re a chance to side-step major problems. Audi actually recalled many of its models to deal with these gearbox issues at the time.The other thing to be sure of is that any used Audi you buy has a complete service history with no gaps or late services. These cars use high-tech engines that absolutely require clean oil and filters at regular intervals. A neglected Audi is a very good chance to be a pain in the wallet down the track. Like many second-hand prestige cars, these Audis are often cheap for a reason."

        "question": "Toyota Yaris 2011 and Honda Jazz 2005: Engine longevity",
        "answer": "A few factors determine engine longevity, so let’s start with the first of those, the basic materials and design of the engine in question. Both the Toyota and Honda have advanced small-capacity engines that are made from quality materials. So that’s in their favour.The second factor is servicing. A lack of regular maintenance including fresh oil and filters will kill engines fast, so that’s crucial. And finally, how they are driven will also play a part. An engine that only does long distances in the country will always last longer than one that is subjected to frequent cold starts and stop-start traffic. An engine that is regularly revved to redline between the gears will also potentially die younger than one that is driven sensibly and with a bit of mechanical sympathy.The bottom line? There’s no short answer. But I have seen small-capacity Honda and Toyota engines clock up 250,000km and more with correct maintenance. Things have certainly changed from the 1950s when the average car engine needed a rebuilt every 100,000km and what was called a de-coke and valve-grind every 30,000km. Ask your grandfather about it."

        "question": "What small SUV do you recommend?",
        "answer": "It sounds like you have a bit of a thing for French cars right now, Carmel. In fact, you could argue that the French brands are experiencing a bit of a resurgence in Australia, particularly as each brand gets its quality act closer to the mark and the factory warranties have never been better than right now.All three of the cars you’ve nominated have their strong points, and it will really come down to your personal preferences when it comes to which one is right for you. And let me guess; it was the Peugeot 2008’s odd dashboard/steering wheel relationship that put you off. That’s particularly true for shorter folk who have trouble looking over the wheel at the instruments. But then, such quirkiness has always been part of the charm of French cars, no?In any case, it would also be wise to sample the Japanese and South Korean contenders at this end of the market, too, as there are some interesting offerings there as well. The Toyota C-HR would be one, the Honda HR-V another. Don’t forget, either, the Hyundai Kona, Nissan Juke and the Mazda CX-3. All have their strengths and weaknesses, but all are worth short-listing.As for the MX-5, it’s true that Mazda has stuck to the original formula for the new latest little convertible. And, yes, that dictates a small, low car that is huge fun to drive but isn’t for everybody physically."

        "question": "Should I buy a Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage or Mazda CX-5?",
        "answer": "The RAV4 in its current guise is the best the model has ever been. Of course, that’s exactly how it should be, but some car-makers don’t always crack the newer-is-better code. You’re right about the new RAV4 Hybrid being the headline grabber, but that’s because it’s the big change in the RAV4 formula and the one that is likely to attract the most new customers to the franchise. There’s nothing wrong with the two-litre CVT RAV4 per se, but you might find the performance of the smaller petrol engine a bit on the weedy side, especially with a full load of bodies and luggage on board. And, as with any CVT car, the advice is to drive it before you decide, and make sure you don’t find the CVT’s behaviour too foreign. Some people do, others never notice it.The Kia Sportage Sport is another good package but suffers the same lacklustre engine performance issue in two-litre petrol form. It does, though, have a conventional six-speed automatic transmission rather than a CVT. And while the Sportage was facelifted in 2018, its basic design goes back to 2015. Which, in fact, makes it an older design than the Mazda CX-5 which was first launched here in 2017. Any of the three vehicles you’ve nominated will do the job but history suggests the Toyota will hold more resale value when trade-in time rolls around. And congratulations on the new addition to the family."

        "question": "What used hybrid should I buy?",
        "answer": "The world of hybrids is moving very fast, Hannah, and the rule of thumb is that newer is better purely because the technology is improving all the time. You’re obviously concerned with running costs and your carbon-footprint, so the latest hybrid technology with a full factory warranty would seem to be an obvious way to go.That puts the new Corolla Hybrid firmly in the frame as both a car with the latest planet-saving and life-saving tech as well as Toyota’s five-year/unlimited-kilometre warranty as well as a ten-year warranty on the hybrid’s batteries. For some reason, Lexus hasn’t budged on its four-year warranty, meaning that a 2017 CT200h might only have a few months of factory cover to run if your bought it now. You’ll also potentially pay more for the second-hand Lexus than you will for the brand-new Corolla.The only real drawback with the Corolla Hybrid is that its luggage space – because of the battery-packs – is quite shallow. But beyond that it’s a great car with the hybrid driveline thrown in for just a couple of grand extra. That’s a bargain and it’s one of the reasons the new Corolla will be a lot of Australian families’ first hybrid."

        "question": "Suzuki APV 2010: Why won't it accelerate?",
        "answer": "This is another problem that really needs the services of a diagnostic computer to make any sort of meaningful assessment of what’s going on here. That said, this engine uses a throttle-position sensor to turn the driver’s right-foot input into forward motion at the engine. If this sensor is not talking to the on-board computer, there’s a good chance you could have the exact condition you’ve described, Shalvesh.On a more fundamental level, are you sure the transmission is selecting gears? Perhaps the vehicle is stuck in neutral somehow. But if the engine won’t even rev up when you hit the throttle, I think you’re looking at some kind of sensor problem."

        "question": "Volkswagen Golf 2019: Should I buy an Alltrack?",
        "answer": "It all depends on where you get your information from, John. Like you, I’ve certainly read reports that the Alltrack franchise is being put to rest in North America in favour of SUVs, but a quick chat with VW Australia revealed that the concept still has legs out here. Perhaps the confusion is over the USA market axing of the cars, while the Alltracks sold here are generally sourced from the German VW factory. In any case, you can expect to see Alltracks in VW showrooms for the foreseeable future.The big question is whether they’ll be available with a diesel engine. My VW insider “hopes so” but recent reports that all VW passenger cars will be petrol powered puts that into doubt, even if the Alltrack models are classed by some sections of the trade as light-commercials. Even if the Alltrack concept survives with a diesel engine option, count on there being a petrol-powered variant available as well.In any case, the notion of the Alltrack becoming a depreciation victim here because the USA stops selling them is not going to be a reality."

        "question": "Nissan Navara 2011: Why does it go into limp mode?",
        "answer": "As with any other problems like this one, Terry, the best advice is to have the car plugged in to a scanner and have a diagnostic mechanic read the fault codes which will hopefully give an idea of the cause of the limp-home mode and unresponsive throttle pedal. It could be something simple, it may be something really intrinsic, but without a scan, you’re flying blind.The oil in the intercooler, meanwhile, is a potentially big problem. A little oil inside the intercooler piping is actually quite normal and is usually the result of oil mist from the crankcase ventilation system condensing and leaving a little oily residue. But a large amount of oil in the intercooler suggests a turbocharger with leaking seals and/or bearings. If the seals are leaking, boost pressure from the turbocharger can force oil from the turbo’s bearing into the intercooler. If that’s the case, you’re looking at a rebuilt or new turbocharger unit. A blown turbo could also be enough to prompt the limp-home mode you’re experiencing."

        "question": "Should I buy a used Honda Jazz?",
        "answer": "Well, if you’re looking for a fuel-efficient car, then a Honda Jazz is a very good choice. With an official combined fuel-consumption figure as low as 5.7 litres per 100km, and the ability to run on the cheaper 91-RON unleaded, the Jazz’s weekly fuel costs will be among the lowest around.But $15,000 is a crazy figure. The entry-level Jazz was only about $16,000 when brand-new, so even though the kilometres showing on this one are extremely low, the price being asked is astronomical. The most expensive 2008 Jazzes out there are asking around $8000 (and that’s too much) with plenty out there for $4000 or less.The difference would be if you meant to type 2018 instead of 2008 (which is a better match with the odometer reading you’re quoting) at which point $15,000 starts to look like roughly the right price to be paying. Either way, the Jazz is nicely built, drives well and will be very economical."

        "question": "What dual cab 4x4 ute should I buy?",
        "answer": "The problem with all these vehicles, Darren, is that they seem to have covered huge distances (200,000km is a lot for a car that is just eight years old, no?). Also, some of them have covered those kilometres towing huge, heavy trailers and a full tray at the same time. So, the first piece of advice is to buy one that has a full service history and hasn’t been worked half to death. A Ranger with a huge bull-bar, suspension lift, winch and mud tyres, for instance, is a dead certainty to have been thrashed through the bush every weekend of its life. So be careful and take each vehicle on its merits and overall condition.It seems you’ve heard of the Ranger’s engine troubles (overheating due to faulty EGR coolers and failed fuel injectors) but the Toyota three-litre turbo-diesel is not without its faults either. Cracked pistons between 100,000km and 150,000km are not unknown and, like any common-rail diesel, the Toyota’s engine can consume injectors at a frightening rate. The bottom line is that all these modern common-rail diesels are highly tuned and absolutely need their maintenance. Even then, they can fail, so it’s worth knowing.For your purposes, Darren, I think the Ranger with its more powerful engine (147kW and 470Nm plays the Toyota’s 120kW and 343Nm) and much greater towing capacity (3500kg for the Ford, 2250kg for the Toyota) would be the smarter way to go."

        "question": "Mazda 3 2007: Can I replace the transmission control module?",
        "answer": "Transmission Control Module (TCM) faults are not unknown on these early Mazda 3s. Symptoms usually involve erratic shifting, a failure to select gear at all and having the car go into limp-home mode. The good news is that there are companies out there who can repair your existing TCM, which gets you around the need to buy an expensive replacement. By the way, from what I can gather, any replacement TCM should be plug-and-play with no need to have the new module coded to the car’s other systems.It’s also worth noting that Mazda in the USA issued a Technical Service Bulletin (like a recall but not for a safety issue) for automatic 3s from this era fitted with the 2.3-litre engine. In some cases, the shift solenoid could lose fluid, leading to harsh shifts and shuddering when driving uphill. The fix was a revised solenoid design but the catch was that the unit lived inside the transmission, so to whole gearbox had to be removed and taken apart to replace the part in question."

        "question": "What small or mid-sized SUV should I buy?",
        "answer": "For a start, some owners are not mad about the Subaru’s CVT transmission. It’s not that it’s necessarily unreliable, they just don’t like the way it works with an occasional hesitation and a slight jerkiness at light throttle applications. Some people never notice it, but others find it a real distraction. The Kia meanwhile, has been getting good reviews across the trade, largely thanks to the Australian-input into the model’s suspension settings.Of course, you need to personally drive all three cars on your short-list as there will be things you like and dislike about each one, some of which will be deal-breakers.The SsangYong is certainly the unknown quantity, but mainly because of the brand’s on-again-off-again relationship with the Australian market. But now, with head-office support (the Australian operation is the only factory-owned distributorship outside the brand’s native South Korea) things are looking a bit brighter for buyers and that’s backed up by the factory seven-year/unlimited kilometre warranty that also includes fixed price servicing and roadside-assistance for seven years. That’s got to represent peace of mind."

        "question": "Suzuki Swift 2012: Transmission \"slipping\" when going up hills",
        "answer": "While the less sporty versions of Suzuki’s Swift of this era used a conventional automatic transmission, the Swift Sport used a CVT transmission. And I’m wondering if maybe that’s all there is to your question. The CVT is quite capable of feeling like its slipping when you use lots of throttle, such as when going up a hill or accelerating to overtake. It’s actually quite normal and is the method a CVT uses to maximise fuel-economy by keeping the engine operating in its most efficient zone.But if you’ve owned the car for some time and its behaviour has changed, then it could be that the CVT is beginning to wear internally. Or perhaps it’s the torque-converter (that links the engine to the transmission) that is starting to wear out and allowing the engine to rev harder than it used to for a given road speed.Suzuki did recall this model (and conventional automatic versions) to check for loose bolts that secured the torque converter to the transmission. But if these became loose and fell out, you’d have no drive at all, so I don’t think that’s the problem here."

        "question": "Subaru Outback 2001-2009: Any known issues with the head gasket?",
        "answer": "You’re absolutely spot on, Craig, although my info suggests the problems started occurring in the Outback model as early as 2000. For other Subaru models, head gasket failures have been an issue since the mid-90s. Then trade seems to think that the typical fail-point is somewhere between the 120,000km and 200,000km mark, but I’ve heard of cases of cars much younger than this suffering gasket failure.So what causes it? Fundamentally, it was a bad design in the head gaskets Subaru was using at the time. The gaskets were a composite type, made up of thin metal sheets that were coated with a graphite-based material. Frankly, they were duds and it’s this simple fact that has caused so many Subaru owners so much grief over the years. Subaru eventually changed the design of the gaskets around 2011 and the problem just stopped.You can spot a Subaru with a head-gasket problem a couple of ways. For a start, the failed gasket will allow coolant to escape and that will lead to the engine overheating. So, a car that runs hot after a distance is a likely suspect.Early failures tended to allow the coolant to leak internally (where it was consumed by the engine) but later generations of the Subaru motor started to experience external leaks and these, obviously, are much easier to spot. Look for an oil leak from around the sealing surface of the head and crankcase and coolant on the ground under the car each morning.The really weird part of all this was that Subarus tend to be otherwise very reliable and durable and, serviced correctly, can cover huge distances. But the problem was made worse by the fact that the Subaru flat-four engine actually has two cylinder-head gaskets, instead of the one of most four-cylinder engines. Replacement of the dud gaskets is the only fix and it’s quite a big – and expensive – job."

        "question": "Honda Civic 2002: Why does it only drive without the petrol cap on?",
        "answer": "I think what’s happening when you open the fuel cap, Frank, is not a release of pressure, but rather a release of vacuum. As your car uses petrol, the level in the tank gets lower. If the tank can’t `breathe’, allowing air to fill that space in the tank, a vacuum is created. Eventually, the vacuum becomes so powerful that the car’s fuel pump can no longer drag fuel from the tank to the engine and the car stalls.When you remove the fuel cap, hey presto, the vacuum is released and the fuel pump can do its thing once more. In modern cars, this is often caused by the charcoal canister (a part of the pollution-control equipment) becoming clogged and not allowing air back into the fuel tank. I’ve actually seen cases so bad that the vacuum has actually collapsed the fuel tank under the car (must have been a powerful fuel pump).Driving around with no fuel cap on is both dangerous and illegal (it renders those pollution controls useless because it allows fuel to evaporate into the atmosphere) so the solution is to find out where the blockage is and replace the relevant parts. Like I said, I’d start with the charcoal canister in the engine bay. It could even be that dust or dirt is blocking one of the rubber hoses that link the pollution gear systems. It might seem like a big problem, but from the symptoms you’ve listed, I think it’ll be an easy fix."

        "question": "Skoda Octavia 2000: Why does the engine keep stopping and won't restart?",
        "answer": "On the surface, it sounds like the electrical system is somehow letting you down, Todor. The no-charge light comes on because the engine has stalled and is not driving the alternator, so that’s probably not the root cause here. But only when the glow-plug light appears (which it should every time you turn the ignition on ready to crank the engine) will the engine fire. That’s the clue that whatever glitch is at work here has settled down and is allowing the electrical system to work properly. Of course, a diesel engine doesn’t have a spark (electric) ignition system, so we could be barking completely up the wrong tree here. That said, the modern diesel engine does use a series of electric fuel pumps, and a faulty pump could easily cause the problem you’ve described.With that in mind, the absolute best advice is to take the car to a workshop with the necessary diagnostic gear and have the car scanned to see what fault codes it coughs up. Until you do that, and can isolate the problem, you can run around in circles for months changing perfectly good components in a costly process of elimination."

        "answer": "I don’t know of any insurance companies that will pay out an increased amount because of recent repairs. The presumption would have been that your car was worth the $6000 agreed-value amount only if it was in good working order and not in a damaged state. Following that presumption is the fact that, if it needed $1500 spent on it to bring it back to that condition, that’s simply a wear and tear cost that is not the insurer’s problem. It’s a cruel world, no?As for the payout figure including (or not) the registration refund, I’d imagine that would be up to the insurer and would be included in the dreaded fine-print. From what I can gather, this is a pretty common inclusion on most policy wordings, and many insurers will adjust the payout down to include the policy excess (if, unlike your case, Tracey, you were at fault) and the unused portion of the CTP insurance and registration. But get this: Some insurers will even deduct the costs of the rest of the year’s insurance premium from your payout, even if you were paying the premium monthly! Never gloss over the fine print."

        "answer": "Volkswagen dealers will recommend this extra service (usually at the six-month mark) for any vehicle that operates in what’s termed `extreme’ conditions. Those conditions can include high ambient temperatures, dusty conditions and even short, stop-start running. But it’s only a recommendation and not having it done shouldn’t affect your warranty or service record.Generally, it amounts to a change of fluids and an upload of any software changes (the latter you’re entitled to for free under warranty at your next scheduled service anyhow). A lot of owners reckon this is a money grab, while others think that a year between oil changes on a high-performance engine like the Golf R’s turbocharged unit is too long in the first place. In the end, it’s up to you to check the owner’s manual and decide for yourself whether the way you drive falls into the extreme category."

        "question": "Toyota Yaris: Is it suitable for off-road driving?",
        "answer": "Driven very, very carefully, a Toyota Yaris would probably make it up the Oodnadatta Track, but it would be a very slow process and the car may never feel the same again. Even a proper off-road four-wheel-drive can suffer at the hands of outback roads like these, and the corrugations have to be experienced to be believed. That theory also presupposes that the track is in relatively good condition at the time and it hasn’t been raining in those parts.Given that the vast bulk of your driving is, indeed, in Yaris territory I can see your point. Perhaps renting a four-wheel-drive for the Oodnadatta Track holiday would be the way to go."

        "answer": "There were three engines offered in the 2016 LDV G10, Brett; a turbo-petrol, a non-turbo petrol and a turbo-diesel. Here’s the answer to all three possibilities: Both the two-litre turbocharged petrol and the turbo-diesel use a timing chain. The 2.4-litre non-turbo petrol engine uses a timing belt.The timing belt will need replacing at regular intervals while the timing chains should be good for the life of the vehicles they are fitted to."

        "question": "What are the best economical small used cars?",
        "answer": "It’s a fact of life, Ted, that fuel-efficiency has been a big focus for car-makers in the last decade. So, the most economical models tend to be the newer ones which tap into better technology (such as stop-start functions) and improved engine and driveline designs.But beyond the improvements in petrol-engine technology, diesel engines have brought some big improvements, as have hybrid vehicles. The real headline makers have been, of course, the plug-in electric vehicles which are now available second-hand for sensible money. I’ve seen Nissan Leafs for sale for less than $20,000 and the plug-in hybrid Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV for similar money.If economy is your number-one aim, stay away from all-wheel-drive cars as the extra driveline friction requires more power and, therefore, fuel to drive it. And don’t forget that how you drive, where you drive and even whether you check you tyre pressure regularly can also have a huge effect on your ultimate fuel economy."

        "question": "Ford Falcon 2002: Why does the engine keep cutting out?",
        "answer": "Computer-controlled engines like the one in your Falcon, Tony, require a range of sensors to provide the information to the computer to allow the engine to run properly. If just one of those sensors sneezes, the engine can shut down without warning.As well as a throttle-position sensor, there are also camshaft-angle, crank-angle, air temperature, coolant temperature, oxygen sensors and more. So the best advice is not to start replacing the sensors one by one, but to have the computer interrogated electronically. The computer will be logging problems as they happen and should be able to tell you exactly which sensor is nodding off intermittently. A Ford dealership along with many independent workshops will have the computer-scan gear to do this. It will save you time and money in the long run.For what it’s worth, since the car cuts out completely, my hunch would be the crank-angle sensor is overheating. So, if you want to persist with a home diagnosis, try this: Carry a bottle of cold water in the car. Then, the next time the engine cuts out, pour the cold water over the crank-angle sensor. If the car suddenly restarts, you’ve found your problem.But to be honest, you could also be looking at a dud fuel pump, a blocked fuel filter and literally a hundred other possibilities."

        "question": "Mercedes 200C 1996: What issues can I expect buying this car second hand?",
        "answer": "You’re kind of in luck, George, because the W202 series of Mercedes-Benz cars is viewed by the trade as the last of the well-built Benzes. Still built in Germany, the W202 was replaced by the W203 at the turn of the century with production of Australian sedans shifting to South Africa (the wagons were still made in Germany). Quality suffered with the switch from W202 to W203 despite the latter being the newer design.But the less wonderful news is that the W202 is still a pretty old car these days and is likely to have covered plenty of kilometres (the 175,000km you’ve nominated is actually quite low). So, there are no hard and fast rules; take every car on its individual merits and be sure to examine each example with a forensic level of detail.Interiors can start to look pretty tired after a couple of decades in the Aussie UV and know that if the vacuum-operated central-locking or heating and ventilation controls ever play up, it can mean a dashboard-out job that can easily cost more than the car is worth. Paint – especially metallic colours – can fade and peel and, again, a respray is likely to cost more than the value of the car itself.Mechanically, these are relatively simple machines but spares can cost plenty and the chances of a previous owner scrimping on maintenance costs at some point in the last 25 years is pretty high. At least there’s a decent aftermarket industry for sourcing bits and pieces. But seriously, these are now old enough to be of interest mainly to the real enthusiasts out there. Buying a Benz that old for the sake of its three-pointed star badge could be asking for trouble."

        "question": "Ford Ranger 2019: What is the noise coming from my car?",
        "answer": "I’ve heard of this before, Sam, and it does seem that it’s caused by the lock-stops banging together and causing the noise you’re hearing. The lock-stop, meantime, is a simple, mechanical device that stops the front wheels turning too far, and to do that, it simply uses one piece of metal that literally bumps into another piece on full lock to prevent further movement. And that’s the noise you’re hearing. That it only happens on with the steering on full lock is the big clue here.Greasing the bits of metal might quieten things down a bit, but I was under the impression that this model Ranger had little plastic caps on the metal parts to prevent the metal-on-metal contact and, therefore, the horrible noises. Either way, I’d be having an expert check the front suspension to make sure the noise isn’t coming for another, more sinister source. You can’t be too careful with this stuff and since the vehicle should still under warranty, what have you got to lose?"

        "question": "Do the Mazda 6, CX-5 and RAV4 all have space saver wheels?",
        "answer": "Mazda only offers space-saver spare tyres on its CX-5 and 6 range, so that’s an easy one to answer. The RAV4 is a bit more complicated because you can option a full-sized spare, but only on the base-model GLX model. And the full-sized spare is not available on the RAV4 hybrid in any form.The move to space-savers gave car-maker a lot more flexibility in packaging terms and saved them money into the bargain (a space-saver is a lot cheaper than an alloy wheel and tyre to match the other four on the car). Along the way, the car with a space-saver will be lighter and that’s a fuel consumption issue all on its own (if a minor one).Fundamentally, there’s nothing wrong with a space-saver for an urban-based car, but bear in mind their speed and distance limitations as well as the fact that braking and handling will be affected by having the space-saver fitted."

        "question": "What is a good vehicle for towing a horse float?",
        "answer": "Let’s start with the four-wheel-drive question, Jess: I reckon a vehicle with four-wheel-drive would be a much better bet for towing anything heavy, especially if you do find yourself on a loose or wet surface (which I imagine mightn’t be too uncommon in the world of the horse fancier). But even a wet bitumen road can be a lot safer in an all-wheel-drive tow-car. So don’t under-estimate the value of all-wheel-drive.The problem with that is that four-wheel-drive dual-cab utes are absolutely the flavour of the month, so second-hand ones are really holding their value. Which means that to get into a, say, Toyota HiLux 4WD ute within your budget, you’re looking at a 15-year-old work-vehicle. And even then, it’s odds-on to have covered more than 250,000km.Sometimes, better value is to be found in four-wheel-drive station wagons like Nissan Patrols and Mitsubishi Pajeros (the Toyota LandCruiser equivalent holds its value extremely well, too, so it’s more expensive). The trick is to find one that has been used as family transport rather than for weekend bush-bashing. Most of them will have enough towing capacity for your needs, too.If you wanted to stick with a conventional utility, did you know that between 2003 and 2006, Holden made an all-wheel-drive version of the Commodore Ute? Called the Crewman, it was a five-seater with a proper tray, the option of a V8 engine and constant all-wheel-drive. They’re well and truly within your budget (and then some) and should be cheaper to run and maintain than a lot of four-wheel-drives. And towing? The Crewman in V8 form (the one you’d want for towing) can legally tow a braked trailer up to 2500kg which should be enough for a two-horse float. Sometimes you have to think laterally about this stuff."

        "answer": "All Hyundais sold new in Australia post-2003 can run on E10 fuel. Really, the only thing to watch out for is if the car has been run on normal ULP for its whole life and you’re only just now changing to E10. That’s because E10 can sometimes loosen deposits in the fuel tank, causing the rusty, scaly deposits to eventually block the fuel filter.So, if this is the first time the car has been run on E10, I’d change the fuel filter now as a precaution, and keep an eye on the filter in the longer term."

        "question": "Do I have a timing belt or chain in my Mitsubishi?",
        "answer": "Assuming we’re talking about a 4B12 engine (Mitsubishi’s internal codes) such as found in a 2016 Lancer or Outlander, then your engine has a timing chain rather than a timing belt. While timing belts need periodic replacement (usually around the 80,000 to 100,000km mark depending on the manufacturer) a timing chain should last the life of the vehicle.However, this hasn’t always been the reality, especially with older Mitsubishi engines such as the Astron 2.6-litre which was found in Australian Magnas. These developed wear in their timing chains early in life and many were replaced. The trade seems to regard the 4B12 pretty highly, though, so it seems these later engines are not prone to the same problems. Even so, as with any engine, I’d be making sure the servicing – and in particular, oil changes – has been done by the book. That’s the cheapest mechanical insurance around."

        "answer": "It can, Jayson, but there’s one vital thing you must check first. Lift the bonnet of your car and find the build date. It should be on a small, silver tag somewhere in the engine bay. Here’s why: Suzuki lists 2008 as the cut-off year for E10 fuel for the Swift. That is, Swifts built before that date can’t use E10, those built after that date can.So why check the build date on your car? Because even though it may have been sold in 2008, it might have been built in 2007. Even if the registration papers list the car as a 2008, it could still have been built in 2007. Paperwork is only as accurate as the person filling it in, but the build-date on the car’s tag doesn’t lie."

        "question": "What are the top five small cars to buy for around $8000?",
        "answer": "It doesn’t sound like a lot of money to spend on a car, does it? But the good news is that an $8000 budget gets you into the realm of some terrific second-hand small cars. For a start, I’d stick with a hatchback layout, purely because they sold better when new, so there are more of them out there to choose from now. Not to mention that a five-door hatchback is a seriously practical vehicle.As for makes and models, well, the world really is your oyster. Conventional wisdom, though, says a second-hand Toyota is usually a pretty safe bet, so look at Corollas from around 2009 or 2010 which fall within your budget, and don’t forget the Yaris with a slightly more recent build date for the same money.Subarus are good buying provided the service history is absolutely spot on and you should be able to find an Impreza in nice condition within your budget. These have held their value really well, so you might find you need to look at slightly older examples form, say, 2007 to 2009. The bonus is an Impreza will have all-wheel-drive, so it’s a good option if you ever use unmade roads and like trips to the snow.Finally, don’t rule out the South Korean brands. Both Hyundai and Kia have been making great cars lately and they represent good value. Try a 2011 or 2012 Hyundai i30 or a Kia Cerato from the same era. The Kia is also a good choice if you prefer a sedan over a hatch as, for some reason, a higher percentage of these were sold new in sedan form.You can buy newer cars, but they probably only fit your budget if they’ve covered a lot more kilometres than the average. Other ways to maximise your spend is to buy an even smaller car (Kia Picanto, Hyundai i20 etc) or shop privately rather than at a used-car yard. Just remember that you have less consumer protection when shopping privately."

        "question": "Should I buy a Honda Odyssey?",
        "answer": "The issue of a lack of performance from the Honda’s 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine is one that has been noted in the past, David. It stems not from the fact that it’s a four-cylinder, rather the way it has been tuned and specified at the factory. Like a lot of Honda engines, the engine was designed to deliver good horsepower and high revs and, while that makes for a sporty feel in the right car, it does nothing for the Odyssey’s role as a people-mover.The root problem here is that the engine is tuned to make its maximum torque (the force that actually accelerates the car) at 4000rpm. Combine that with the odd nature of the standard CVT transmission and you had a recipe for a car that could feel quite lethargic around town. Throw in a full complement of six bodies and their luggage, and things only got worse.Unfortunately, there’s no real way around this. You could have the engine retuned with an aftermarket chip in the computer, but it may not do very much except increase fuel consumption. At that same time, you could wave goodbye to any remaining factory warranty as it applied to the driveline. Manufacturers don’t like customers tinkering with that stuff and will usually claim that the modifications contributed to the mechanical failure.All that being said, I have heard of people `chipping’ the Odyssey’s engine. But of all the examples I’ve seen, the net gain was just 11 or 12 or so kiloWatts; not enough to warrant the cost or transform the vehicle in any major way. Even then, I’d imagine the extra power to be high in the rev range, not down low where you want it."

        "question": "Mazda 3 2017: How can I reduce the cost of regular servicing?",
        "answer": "Capped price servicing is a good way to keep a lid on running costs, or at least know in advance what those costs will be. In the case of Hyundai and Kia cars, they come with capped-price servicing as part of the deal, so provided the car has been servicing correctly by its original owner, you should be able to tap into the capped-price schedule. The catch will be if the car you buy has any gaps in its service history as this could easily render it ineligible for the capped-price package.But really, Jason, what you need to consider is whether cheaper and less frequent servicing is actually going to save you much money. Then put those figures into the context of what it will cost you to change cars in terms of stamp-duty, registration change-over and perhaps even higher insurance costs, and see if it still makes sense as a strategy.If dealer servicing is getting your wallet down, don’t forget that you can change to an independent workshop that might be cheaper than a Mazda dealership. Provided the workshop has the correct certification, it can still stamp your service book and keep your maintenance record (and, therefore, your warranty) intact."

        "answer": "Owners have noted a few problems for these, now, quite old Civics, but as with any other elderly car, you need to take each example on its merits. That said, things to watch out for include fried oxygen sensors in the exhaust system (which will illuminate the `check engine’ light). The power steering can give problems (you’ll still have steering but no assistance) engine mounts can die early and the central locking can pack up due to water entering the system.But by far, the biggest concern with a 2006 Honda Civic is that it was one of hundreds of models caught up in the Takata air-bag fiasco that is still causing grief for car owners around the world. Make sure any car you’re considering has been attended to and had its faulty air-bags replaced.As for value, that will vary enormously according to what condition the car is in and how many kilometres it’s covered. But we wouldn’t be spending any more than, say, $5000 or $6000 for a well-equipped example in neat condition."

But I’ll take a stab in the dark and guess that you’re referring to the Constantly Variable Transmission (CVT) now fitted to different Honda models.In the bad old days, CVTs were only used on small, less powerful engines, because they couldn’t really cope with high horsepower or, more correctly, high torque applications. But as the technology matured and things like metallurgy improved, the CVT has moved into the mainstream.A few years ago, we knew CVTs had really arrived when Nissan fitted one to its quite powerful and heavy Murano SUV. So, really, you shouldn’t have any worries with a CVT in a car like a Honda Civic or HR-V.As for the lifespan of a modern transmission, ideally you’d like it to last the life of the rest of the car. And to be honest, any car-maker that can’t build a transmission that lasts at least 200,000km (at a minimum) isn’t paying attention.hon"

        "question": "Toyota RAV4 2017: Are there any issues with the diesel model?",
        "answer": "There are circumstances under which you would stay away from a modern turbo-diesel, but they have more to do with how you’ll use the vehicle than they do with the vehicle itself. The rule of thumb is that you should really only buy a diesel version of a particular car if you plan to use it for at least one decent trip at freeway speeds every three or four weeks at the very least. Along with that is the proviso that you’ll cover enough kilometres each year to balance the higher purchase price and servicing costs of a diesel against the lower fuel costs.The highway-driving caveat is all about long-term reliability and emissions. Modern turbo-diesels are often fitted with what’s called a diesel-particulate filter (DPF). This filter, designed to trap some of the more harmful exhaust emissions) eventually fills up with the soot from the diesel’s exhaust and, when that happens, it’s designed to burn off that soot and regenerate itself, ready for another go round. But if you only drive short distances or only ever at suburban speeds, the filter can often not get hot enough to perform this burn-off and regeneration. When that happens, the filter warning light on your dashboard lights up and it’s off to the dealership for a – sometimes – costly manual regeneration. In extreme cases, the DPF may even need to be replaced and that’s not cheap either.So, if you’re not planning regular trips at freeway speeds, conventional wisdom says a modern turbo-diesel is not for you."

        "answer": "completely redesigned the RAV4 for an Australian launch back in January 2019, so don’t expect wholesale changes until the mid-life facelift probably in another coupe of years. That’s as far as the basic engineering goes, of course, but in specification and option terms there could be some shuffling around as Toyota is continually homing in on the sweet spot when it comes to equipment versus price-point.The other thing to watch out for – and Toyota is very good at this – is the limited-edition variant of the RAV4. These variants usually offer a load of standard equipment at a bargain price and are a car company’s way of clearing the shelves. Look out, too, in coming weeks, for good deals on RAV4’s (and any other make and model) with a 2019 build-date as these are often heavily discounted in the first few weeks of a new year.

But it’s not that simple and even though the two are both Skoda Octavias, they are really very different vehicles in every other respect.While the Sport model is a sensible, practical (despite the Sport badge) sedan or wagon, the RS245 is a much more driver-focussed, sporty machine. The latter is much more firmly suspended and has performance braking hardware and big alloy wheels as well as a clever mechanical front differential to maximise its grip. The differences under the bonnet are just as obvious and with 110kW in the Sport playing 180kW in the RS245, you can guess which is the faster car to drive.So it really comes down to how much you value a car’s sporty nature. If you do, that $15,000 price jump might not seem so bad. If you don’t the RS245 becomes a very expensive take on the Octavia formula."

        "question": "Nissan Navara 2008: Where is the device for opening the bonnet?",
        "answer": "Opening the bonnet is a two-step process, Chris. First you need to locate the bonnet release catch which, on a 2008 Navara is located on the lower edge of the dashboard, just to the right of the steering column. It should be just under the button that controls the VDC (stability-control) program. It should be a little plastic catch that you pull towards you. When you do, you should feel the catch `give’ and see the bonnet spring up a few millimetres.Step two is to go around to the front of the car, and run your hand along in the space between the bonnet and the grille until you find the secondary catch which has to be pushed to one side to allow the bonnet to be lifted open. Be careful, though: Don’t let the bonnet fall on to your fingers and don’t shove your hand too far under the bonnet as there are hot components like the radiator in there as well. This second, safety catch is there in case the interior release gets bumped while the car is being driven. At which point the bonnet could fly open with interesting consequences.From memory, that model Navara also used a manual bonnet stay rather than gas struts to hold it open. So you’ll need to hold the bonnet open and manually put the stay in place to prevent the bonnet from falling on your head."

Things like anti-lock brakes and stability control have been standard on most cars for years now, but the above, newer technologies are still filtering down from high-end cars into the more democratised part of the market.But make sure you know exactly what you’re buying as sometimes these safety technologies are bundled up as part of an extra-cost option when the cars are bought new.

Certainly, it’s about what a dealer would offer as a trade-in on a new LandCruiser, so it’s a good deal at that money.The best thing you can do is sit your mate down, look him in the eye and get honest answers about how the vehicle has been used and what condition it’s in. This was a relatively early example of the turbo-diesel V8 and while they improved as Toyota made running changes, the early engines were known to burn a bit of oil. After his years of ownership, your pal should be well aware of things like that, so get some straight answers.If it checks out, that’s great, but you’d still want to have a contingency budget for repairs as these were complex machines, and even jobs like replacing the starter motor (which lives up under the inlet manifold on these V8s) can cost a motzah to complete. That said, I love the idea that the vehicle has done mostly highway kilometres and that it’s never been off road. Seriously, that’s the second-hand LandCruiser you want to buy."

The fact that you can select all those gears but not have any drive in them suggests that something on that shaft is failing to mesh with either the countershaft or the output shaft.Does the gearbox make any weird noises when you select any of the first three gears? Is there any oil leaking from the gearbox casing? It could be anything from a stripped gear or spline to a failed bearing.

At least if the top three gears are working, everything downstream of the gearbox seems to be okay."

        "answer": "Starting an engine from cold requires a richer (more fuel, less air) mixture than the engine needs when it’s up to operating temperature. Because the inside of the engine is cold on the first start of each day, this richer mixture gives the engine the chance to run smoothly and not stall. Remember old cars with choke levers? It’s the same thing except that now, the computer controls the choke.So, yes, that’s why you sometimes detect a petrol smell when a car first starts up. But make sure the smell goes away and doesn’t stick around the whole time the car is running, or you could be looking at a fuel-injection problem that will need addressing. And don’t confuse a petrol smell with an oil smell. If you can smell oil or see blue smoke on start-up, then you’re possibly looking at a worn or leaking engine."

        "answer": "Probably not as much as you might think, Lisa. SUVs are generally based on a hatchback or sedan, and – generalising again – they use the same engines and transmissions. As you’ve identified, they’re a bit taller, but they’re not always larger inside thanks to the sometimes larger suspension towers intruding into the cabin space.You’ll often find extra gear such as plastic wheel-arch flares and bigger bumper bars but, usually, these are nothing more than visual additions to make the SUV look tough and butch. You’ll often find different tyres on the SUV version, too, but a bigger difference (and it’s becoming less and less common) is the addition of all-wheel-drive (most hatches are now front-wheel-drive) which adds weight and complexity and seems a bit odd since these are not off-road vehicles by any stretch of the imagination.Meantime, the biggest difference between an SUV and the hatchback it’s based on? Usually the price-tag."

        "question": "Mazda BT-50 2013:",
        "answer": "This is, indeed, a known problem with Ford (and other) automatic transmissions. The layout of your transmission uses the engine’s coolant to cool the transmission by running a transmission fluid line through the radiator. And yes, when that line fails, the coolant mixes with the transmission fluid. That leads the transmission to fail mechanically (the coolant doesn’t lubricate the transmission) as well as the coolant destroying the transmission’s computer.By insurance, I take it that you took out an extended mechanical insurance policy when you bought the car, because general car insurance won’t cover mechanical failures such as this. Given the get-out clauses with which some of these policies are riddled, I’m not surprised that you aren’t covered for the full cost of the repair.Mazda increased its factory warranty to five years/unlimited kilometres in August 2018, but when your car was new, it was covered for only three years. I’d still be giving my Mazda dealer a call, though, as you might find the relatively low kilometres you’ve covered might convince them to make a pro-rata offer for part of the repair costs. I wouldn’t hold my breath, but it’s got to be worth a try. And, no, I don’t consider 98,000km to be a reasonable distance for a modern transmission to fail."

        "question": "Can the Toyota HiLux be flat-towed?",
        "answer": "Flat-towing – where the towed vehicle has all four wheels on the ground – is common in North America where it’s quite normal to see a motorhome flat-towing a Chevy Suburban or Ford SUV. The idea is that the motorhome is the mother-ship and the SUV becomes the grocery-getter once you’ve settled in somewhere with a nice view. They take their fun seriously, those Americans.The practice is much less common here, but I’ve seen a few Suzuki Sierras and Vitaras and other small four-wheel-drives being flat-towed, so clearly it’s possible. As you’ve identified, a two-wheel-drive vehicle with a conventional manual gearbox shouldn’t suffer any dramas from being flat-towed. That said, I’d be careful with a four-wheel-drive, particularly a permanent all-wheel-drive example - because these are more complex drivelines and sometimes don’t appreciate being back-loaded.  It’s also worth remembering that a vehicle with a conventional automatic is a no-no for flat-towing as, unless the engine is running, the pump that lubricates the transmission isn’t working and the gearbox will be destroyed.Unless the dealer can show you precisely why a particular year-model HiLux shouldn’t be flat-towed, I’d be a bit suspicious (especially when other dealers say yes) but the fact that nobody wants to offer you a warranty on a HiLux that’s being flat-towed also suggests to me that you could run into problems if there’s ever a claim.It would also be worth checking what your insurance company says about flat-towing and don’t forget that different States and Territories have different rules and regulations. In Queensland, for instance, the law says that unless the unladen mass of the towing vehicle is at least three-and-a-half times the laden mass of the vehicle being flat-towed, you need to somehow make the towed vehicle’s brakes part of the package. On that basis, unless you’re towing your 1500kg HiLux with a vehicle that weighs at least 5250kg unladen, you’ve got yourself a problem that could involve the law and the insurance industry if something goes wrong."

        "question": "Holden Barina 2000: Why does my car randomly lose momentum?",
        "answer": "Diagnosing problems like this one are difficult, Willie, mainly because you can bet your bottom dollar that the car won’t reproduce the problem when your mechanic drives it. But three or four times every tank of fuel is not funny and, should the problem rear its head just as you’re about to enter a busy road or turn across traffic, it could be very dangerous, too.But the fact that the car runs perfectly most of the time suggests that it’s not a problem with any of the actual, mechanical engine parts, or it wouldn’t run properly at all. That leaves you with fuel, spark or the computer that controls everything as your most likely suspects. A dodgy sensor such as a crank-angle, camshaft-angle, temperature, oxygen or throttle-position sensor can cause problems like these and sensors have definitely been known to throw up intermittent faults.The best bet is to have the car scanned by a dealership or workshop with the correct computer gear. Otherwise you could be chasing your tail for weeks, wasting time and money as you change sensors that were working properly and still not fix the problem."

        "question": "Hyundai Santa Fe 2019: Should I buy the diesel version?",
        "answer": "You can work this out mathematically if bald numbers don’t scare you. The petrol four-cylinder Santa Fe is $3000 cheaper than the diesel. In all-wheel-drive form, the diesel has an official combined fuel consumption figure of 7.5 litres per 100km, while the petrol scores 9.3 litres. That means, that for every 100km travelled (based on those official test figures, remember) the petrol will use 1.8 litres more fuel. Based on $1.50 per litre, that means the petrol will cost about $2.70 more to run for every 100km, and that means you’d need to cover roughly 111,000km before you broke even on the extra purchase-price of the diesel. Even then, it’s not that simple as the diesel might be more expensive to service and maintain. Either way, though, petrol starts to look good.That said, you sound like you’re in the perfect situation to make the most of a diesel engine. Yes, the turbo-diesel will tow a small caravan better than the four-cylinder petrol Santa Fe and, provided you do at least some country driving every month or so, you shouldn’t need to worry about the diesel particulate filter filling up or failing. Country driving will also stretch the diesel’s fuel consumption advantage further.My advice? Drive both and make a decision based on the smoothness of the petrol or the relaxed flexibility and towing smarts of the diesel."

And that’s not to say there’s anything inherently wrong with the Nissan Cube, but it was only sold here as a private import with all the insurance, servicing and spare-parts hassles that can bring with it.But besides all that, the Rukus is, mechanically speaking, the previous-generation Toyota Camry, built on a Corolla platform with a super-useable boxy body. So, as well as being amazingly practical, it should also be a zero-hassle ownership experience. The Rukus might not have the pizzazz of the Nissan, but it’s the one to buy second-hand."

        "question": "Hyundai i30 2015: Radio recall?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, you’re unlikely to get a manufacturer to pay for repairs on a car that is well and truly out of warranty (as a 2013 Hyundai, which came with a five-year warranty, is). The difference would be if the faulty radio was a pre-existing condition that Hyundai had been notified of before the warranty ran out.It’s very unlikely that a car-maker would issue a recall for something like a faulty radio, as recalls are generally caused by safety-related problems and faults. But manufacturers do issue TSBs (Technical Service Bulletins) for non-safety problems.I have heard of Hyundai radio units giving trouble, usually starting with a lack of volume and working their way up to no sound and then no power at all. The good news is that the trade knows about it and there are specialists who have a dedicated fix for these units. In the meantime, it would certainly be worth asking your Hyundai dealer if they’ll fix or replace the head-unit. For instance, since you’re obviously a Hyundai family, or if you were a long-time, repeat customer, you might find the dealership will listen sympathetically in order to keep your business into the future. But don’t go to the bank on it."

        "question": "What car should I buy?",
        "answer": "Obviously, the safety of your grandkids is the primary concern here, so definitely go for a car with a five-star safety rating. Something with side-curtain air-bags is a good idea, too, as it provides air-bag protection for the rear seats as well as those travelling in the front.A car with autonomous braking and all the driver and braking aids is also worth the extra investment. That way, you’re less likely to be caught up in a prang in the first place.Beyond that, Marlene, the world is your oyster with the budget you have, and $18,000 buys some terrific second-hand cars. I’d look at a Toyota Camry, Mazda 6 or a late-model Hyundai Sonata. Remember that the later the build date, the more safety equipment you’ll be buying.Make sure you find a car that is comfortable for you to drive and that suits the rest of your circumstances. As in, will it fit easily in your garage and can you afford to maintain it and put fuel in it."

        "question": "Hyundai ix35 2011: Where do I take my car to fix electrical glitches?",
        "answer": "With that list of problems, I’d be looking at having the body computer checked, at either a Hyundai dealership or a known automotive electronics specialist. Modern cars have computers to control not just the engine and driveline’s behaviour, but also the functions you’ve mentioned.Central locking and sunroof problems are classic examples of a body computer that is not playing the game. You might find a specialist can reboot the computer to fix these flaws, but you may also be looking at a complete computer replacement.But before you do any of that, try this little hack: Lock the vehicle and when you press the button to unlock it, hold the unlock button down for at least 30 seconds. Believe it or not, this can sometimes re-set the body computer and will fix all your problems. It’s a bit of a long-shot, but definitely worth a try."

        "question": "What would the battery warranty be like on a used Toyota Corolla?",
        "answer": "Because you’re looking at a car built before January 1 2019, the vehicle won’t carry Toyota’s current, upgraded five-year factory warranty. Instead, you’ll get what’s left of the three-year/100,000km factory warranty. In the case of a hybrid Toyota, that also includes eight years and 160,000km worth of cover for the batteries, so if the car you buy is just two or three years old, you’ll have anything up to six years of warranty on the battery-pack. That’s a pretty good deal.The catch is that the car you buy must have a full service record that shows it has not been neglected in any way. If the service record has gaps in it, Toyota has the right to cancel the warranty on that particular vehicle.Modern hybrids are clever in that when a battery cell fails, only the dud cell (rather than the whole battery-pack) needs to be replaced. Our experience, too, in this department is that Toyota hybrids are hitting wrecking yards (thanks to crashes) faster than they’re wearing out their battery-packs. That means there’s a decent supply of second-hand batteries with lots of life left in them at reasonable prices. One quote for a second-hand Prius battery-pack was between $1500 and $2000 from a wrecking yard."

        "question": "Toyota Camry 2012: Can I mix fully synthetic and semi synthetic oils?",
        "answer": "Let me guess, you did an oil change 12 months ago using semi-synthetic oil and then another one six months ago using fully-synthetic. And now, there’s just enough oil left in either container that, if you combined them, you could do the next oil change without buying more oil. Am I close?Anyway, the short answer is no, you shouldn’t mix two different types or grades of oil. Remember the old Castrol TV ads; Oils aint oils? Well, it should have been: Oils aint just oils. Oil isn’t just refined crude; a modern automotive engine oil is made up of lots of components, collectively referred to as additives. These additives make oil more effective at both high and low temperatures as well as providing extra protection and sometimes even a cleaning function.Which is great, but the different additives in different oils sometimes don’t get along too well when they’re mixed. Sometimes they can cancel each other out, at which point you’re suddenly using oil that doesn’t protect as well as it should.Keep the spare oil from each oil change as a top-up (something you probably won’t need in a relatively new Toyota Camry). And if it’s not needed for that, give the poor old lawn-mower an oil change with the left-overs. How long since the mower or brush-cutter got some love?"

        "question": "Toyota Yaris 2006: Doors will not open",
        "answer": "It sounds like part of the mechanism that operates the door latch has broken or melted or fallen off or in some other way failed. I’m not sure about the specifics of the rear doors on a 2006 Yaris, but the solution is to get inside the door and operate the latch mechanically to open the door. But that can be easier said than done.If you can lower the window in that door, you might find a locksmith or specialist safe-breaker who can use a hook to manipulate the latch. But in many cases, the only solution is to remove the interior door trim to get at the broken mechanism. The problem there, of course, is that the door trim will be hard up against the door jamb and the rubber deals, so removing it can be a huge problem.In some cases, you’ll be able to remove/lift one corner of the door trim to gain access, but I can’t guarantee that the trim won’t be damaged in this operation. Once it’s damaged, of course, all bets are off and you can cut a hole in the trim to gain the access you need to trigger the latch.And the better news is that there are plenty of Yarises in wrecking yards waiting to give up their door trim to replace the one you’re about to butcher. And if memory serves, all Yarises had the same colour interior, so finding a matching door trim won’t be too difficult."

        "question": "Is it easy to change the oil yourself?",
        "answer": "This is one of those `if you have to ask, it’s not for you’ questions, I’m afraid. Changing a car’s oil is not, in and of itself, a difficult mechanical challenge, but getting it wrong can easily cost you an engine rebuild, so it’s vital that you’re across the job. And when you consider that an oil and filter change (as opposed to a full service) at an independent workshop for a conventional car in an urban area shouldn’t cost more than about $150, there’s maybe not so much to gain. Not when you consider the cost of the oil and filter should be included in that price.The other big advantage of having a workshop change your oil is that they’ll be able to dispose of the used oil in a legal and environmentally sound way. Otherwise, you stand to have four or five litres of filthy, toxic used engine oil in a pan just waiting for you to trip over it in the garage next day and create a messy bio-hazard.The best advice is to always use good quality oil (a name you recognise is a good start) and give extra-cheap or supermarket-chain-branded oil filters a miss as they’re quite often poor quality and can cause their own problems, including engine failures."

        "question": "What towing capacity do I need for a float with two horses?",
        "answer": "The rule of thumb is that a float with two horses on board is around the 2000kg mark, so that’s the absolute bare minimum towing limit you’d be looking at. Even then, by the time you add a couple of saddles, some feed bins and whatever else it is horsey people cart around, you could easily be looking at 2.5 or even three tonnes.With that in mind, the smart move would be to buy a dual-cab ute with as much towing capacity as possible. The good news there is that many of the popular choices can tow a braked trailer weighing anything up to 3.5 tonnes. Think about it; if a ute can tow 3.5 tonnes, it should cope easily with two tonnes.If, on the other hand, we’re talking a three-axle float and a pair of Clydesdale horses, you might have to look at one of the US-made utes from the likes of RAM or other US-market brands. And even then, you need to be careful: Even though some versions of the RAM ute can legally tow 4500kg with a braked trailer, to do so and not exceed the GCM (the combined mass of the vehicle and trailer) the payload in the tray falls to less than 100kg."

        "question": "Should I buy an Audi A3 or A4?",
        "answer": "It would pay to bear in mind, Tony that there’s an all-new A3 due in Europe next year (Check out Carsguide’s overage of the Geneva Motor Show when it happens) as well as a major upgrade of the A4 that will include new or comprehensively revised engines and mostly new body panels and interior.Is the heavily discounted A4 a dealership demonstrator? As that might explain why the A4, even though it’s the bigger car, has had its price slashed, despite having all that desirable kit thrown in. That said, the A4 lives in a market segment (mid-sized sedans) that is not doing terribly well right now (in Australia and elsewhere) so maybe Audi has too much stock of a car that has plenty of competition (Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3-Series) in a struggling market.The bottom line, however, is to buy as much car as you need and don’t make the mistake of buying a smaller, cheaper car when it won’t easily do the jobs you have in mind for it. Again, though, the A3 is a pretty practical hatchback (or sedan) and owners don’t seem to complain that it’s underdone in any major way.So, drive them both, and see which one you like to pilot. And then start throwing offers at the salesman and see how much he or she is able to bend on either car. By the way, the virtual cockpit is brilliant technology."

        "answer": "Nissan made a big song and dance about the new infotainment system on its 2019 Navara, and rightly so, because the vehicle had been off the pace in this regard compared with its major competitors. The changes included the inclusion of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but also included full smart-phone mirroring.None of which is much use to you, Dom, because if the system won’t connect to your phone without dropping out, it’s a moot point, yes? I’d be straight back to the dealer to have it sorted out. The computer that controls the infotainment might need a re-boot or maybe there’s a more fundamental problem. Either way, Nissan’s factory warranty should cover this.But before you do that, try one thing: Pair the car with a different phone just to rule out the possibility that it’s your phone that the upgraded system doesn’t like."

        "answer": "There’s not a lot of good news here for the home mechanic, I’m afraid. No doubt some of the code-readers you can buy online will do the job, but it’s all a bit of a lottery. In many cases, you’re buying a code-reader from overseas, and while it might cover the car you own, it might be loaded with the software for a different version of the same model. Also, you can’t update the reader with new software as it becomes available and, in many cases, you’ll need more than one code-reader to cover all of the car’s systems.According to a lot of workshops, generic code-readers aren’t worth the bother and will often only give you the fault code-number, rather than an explanation of what the fault actually is. Sometimes, they’ll just flash up a message that you should refer the problem to a dealership. Not very helpful.I spoke to a Daewoo specialist workshop about this and was told that the code-readers worth bothering with start at about $8000 and go all the way to $12,000.

        "question": "Isuzu D-Max 2010: Do the front wheel bearings need repacking every 30,000 kms?",
        "answer": "From experience, vehicles like the D-Max (and many others) are very hard on front wheel bearings. But you’re right, that’s really because the majority of them are all-wheel-drive while yours is rear-drive. So I would imagine wheel-bearing service intervals would be a lot longer than 30,000km.The problem with four-wheel-drives is that the front wheels are being asked to do an awful lot. As well as steering the vehicle, they also have torque going to them from the engine. Also, since these vehicles tend to be used off-road, the wheels and bearings are routinely dunked in silty or even salty water. That shortens the lifespan of any components. The heavy turbo-diesel engine sitting over the front wheels also adds to wear in these cars, and could be part of the reason for such regular maintenance.Or, it may simply be that Isuzu has made a blanket decision that all D-Maxes, regardless of driveline, have their wheel bearings repacked every 30,000km. It certainly won’t hurt to have the bearings inspected every 30,000km, but I’d be very surprised if they needed repacking every time. Some of these vehicles also use a sealed-for-life bearing and require replacement rather than repacking.The difference would be if your vehicle was still under warranty (which, being a 2010 model, it’s not) at which point you’d need to stick with the factory service schedule to keep your warranty intact."

        "answer": "I’ll assume you had a good poke around the various settings menus before contacting us, Sweta, so I’ll skip that part of the advice. But from what I can gather, your privately-imported car may not actually have the functionality to switch to an English-language format.Different markets have different specifications for this and sometimes the same vehicle can be built in two (or more) different factories around the world. Certainly, if the car you own had been destined for a market outside Japan, it would have had multi-lingual abilities. But, if it was only ever destined for the Japanese home market, there’s a big chance it only has Japanese programmed into it.If that’s the case, you might find you need to change the entire head unit. That might be wise anyway, as some Japanese radio stations operate on a wave-length that isn’t used in Australia. Basically, this is another of the pitfalls of parallel-imported cars."

Keen driveaway pricing also works in the Kia’s favour, however. Frankly, both are great cars with lots of useable performance (they share the same engine, actually) and practical layouts.So, it could come down to a philosophical debate: The i30 N Line sits one rung below the hero i30 version, the N. The GT, meanwhile, is the flagship Cerato, so you don’t need to explain to the neighbours why you didn’t buy the flashest one. But for a lot of buyers, a manual transmission is the gearbox of choice in quick little hatches like these, and only the Hyundai offers a six-speed manual or a seven-speed DCT. In the Kia, it’s the DCT or nothing."

True, you probably shouldn’t buy any relatively new vehicle without this document, but the Subaru engine is renowned for being reliable and durable provided it has never had any skipped oil changes. Skipped servicing allows sludge to build up in the oil, and the Subaru’s intricate oilways won’t tolerate it. Eventually, they gunk up and block the flow of oil to various vital engine components.The Tiguan is a lovely car to drive, but concerns over its DSG transmission remain to haunt it and its stablemates.

        "answer": "Jump-starting a modern, computer-controlled car is fraught with dangers. Get it wrong and you can fry the electronics and that’s bound to cost plenty if you damage – and need to replace - the on-board brain. The conventional advice is to connect the positive lead of the jump-start kit to the positive terminal of your car, but attach the negative lead of the jump-pack to a solid, metal part of the car. As in, not the actual negative battery terminal. That reduces the chance of sparks that could ignite the flammable gasses batteries give off. Make sure the ignition is switched off when you connect, too.The best advice is to also make sure you’re using a set of surge-protected jumper leads ort a jump-pack that’s similarly protected as it’s the power surge (or spike) that kills electronics. The other piece of advice is; if you’re unsure about jump-starting, leave it to somebody who knows."

        "answer": "Opinions are divided on this subject, Steve, but there’s a school of thought that says you shouldn’t tow anything heavy in an overdrive gear. Manual-gearbox Toyota LandCruisers of the last 30 years or so are prime examples of this, and hauling a heavy load in fifth gear in these can destroy a gearbox real quick. But all vehicles will be better off with overdrive locked out while towing; it’s just kinder to the driveline. So, your decision to tow in fifth gear rather than sixth is a sound one.The only catch with some vehicles is that both fifth and sixth gears are overdriven. But fifth gear in the BT-50’s automatic gearbox is not, it’s 1:1, so you should be fine as long as you don’t exceed the manufacturer’s towing limits at any stage.As for putting bigger wheels and tyres on the BT-50, you’d actually be altering the gearing, making it taller, which means the vehicle may not cover ground as effortlessly as it does now. Hills and headwinds might require more throttle, too, and that will mean higher fuel consumption."

In much the same way as the American car industry used to do, Subaru actually releases their cars by model year or MY code generally in the August or September of the previous year. So you have a 2017-spec Forester which was built in 2016."

        "answer": "The question of whether the Kia is too small compared to the Subaru or Toyota really comes down to your individual situation, Greg. However, while the Seltos is marketed as a competitor for the Mazda CX-3 or Hyundai Kona it is much larger than both those compact cross-overs, measuring up only 40mm shorter than its larger Sportage sibling! It is a great-looking machine but I’d go for an all-wheel-drive model to avoid the 2WD’s antiquated torsion-beam rear-end."

The easiest way to find a manually operated handbrake today is in dual-cab utes and their wagon-style siblings, like the Holden Colorado, Toyota HiLux and Prado, Ford Ranger and Everest, Mitsubishi Triton, Isuzu D-Max and MU-X, and Nissan Navara."

        "question": "What car is able to tow a minimum of 2200kgs?",
        "answer": "If comfort and solid heavyweight tow-ratings are on your shopping list I’d recommend looking at the turbo-diesel V6 Land Rover Discovery, or the 200-series Toyota LandCruiser GXL. Both are superior tow vehicles to many dual-cab utes on the market, while offering genuine luxury in their cabins, and plush coil-sprung suspension. If a 4x4 leaves your mustard un-cut I’d be suggesting a large full-size American-built pick-up like a Dodge Ram, Ford F-150 or HSV Silverado."

So far Hyundai has not indicated there has been any change to this TSB. When looking at cars to flat-tow behind a recreational vehicle (RV) ensure the tow vehicle has the required rating to tow the mass you’re intending to pull."

        "question": "Toyota FJ Cruiser 2014: How many kms should a second hand car have?",
        "answer": "Hi Rebecca, generally 100,000km isn’t a concern on rugged off-road vehicles like Toyota’s retro-cool FJ Cruiser, as this has been spread out over five years now and most people will rack up at least 20,000km per-year. The crucial aspect to this is whether the FJ has a full service history (major services happen every 80,000km and 100k kilometres), and whether the bulk of those kilometres were done around town in stop-start driving, or on longer trips which cause less strain on mechanical parts. In most cases parts won’t simply start falling off once you hit 200,000km and a well looked-after FJ should be able to reach over 300,000km before major components will need to be reconditioned. As to the value I have seen sub-100,000km-old examples listed as low as $32,000 and some as high as $45,000 so it will come down to the individual FJ’s history. I would definitely have a look at the prices around Australia as you might find bargains a short road-trip away."

        "question": "Volkswagen Passat 2012: What does the flashing wrench indicator mean?",
        "answer": "Hi Chloe, the wrench symbol is the service indicator light on this generation of Passat. I would take the car to your nearest licenced mechanical repairer and have them read the fault codes logged in the ECU, which is basically your car’s brain. Basically, when a part of your car stops working properly it sends an error message to the ECU, which has an error code it can display when the mechanic plugs their scan tool into the computer. This model Passat had an issue where the service light would come on, requiring the ECU’s software to be updated by the dealer. I’d take the car in and see what error codes come up as the first job."

        "answer": "Normally this would be an issue with the glow plugs, but the 2.5 turbo-diesel Rangers seem to occasionally have an issue with the assembly around the fuel filter (which includes the water trap and primer pump) sucking in air. This can be fixed by replacing the unit as a whole. Similarly Ranger owners have reported trouble cold-starting their 2.5 TD when the valve stopping fuel flowing back into the tank from the pump fails. Try priming your fuel system a couple of times before starting and if it starts up fine then replace that valve near the fuel pump."

The company will be pushing hard to make that happen. The VW ID3 is likely not going to be here until 2021, likely the mid or latter part of that year. It certainly has a lot of potential, and with pricing set to start below $50,000, it could well be The People’s (Electric) Car. There are other options coming, though it depends on your diary and your budget.You could consider the Tesla Model S, which may have been around for a while, but that also means it has a more traceable reliability history. It has a digital instrument cluster in the regular spot as well.Have you looked at the Jaguar i-Pace? It has a claimed range of 470 kilometres, though it is on the pricey side of the equation, starting from about $125,000.Indeed, a high price tag is a common theme among those EVs with big battery capacity and expansive driving range, because you’re basically covering the cost of the batteries with your money.For instance, there’s the Audi e-tron quattro, which is due here in early 2020. That model will have a range of “more than 400 kilometres”, and - we suspect - a price tag above $120,000. The Mercedes EQC is about to go on sale, too. Range for that mid-size SUV is pegged at about 450 kilometres, but again, you can expect a high price tag.If 2021 isn’t too long to wait, there’s the Volvo XC40 Recharge coming then. Based on our previous experience with Volvo XC40s, it’ll be a great small SUV, with predicted range of 400km - though we think that’s understating it, because it has a 78kWh battery pack, and it has AWD too.At the more affordable end - though admittedly still not quite meeting your expectations for range - there’s the very impressive Hyundai Kona Electric, which has a WLTP range of 449km, and a price tag of around $65k. It isn’t all-wheel drive though.And MG is about to launch a real upstart in the segment, with the ZS EV hitting showrooms soon for $46,990 drive-away, albeit with a range of 262km. It’s also FWD only. The Mini Cooper SE will also arrive in mid-2020, with pricing set to be less than $60k. But again, a range of 270km will likely rule it out for your needs, and its 2WD as well.Another new small EV due next year is the Mazda MX-30. Pricing is still to be confirmed, and range isn’t great at about 300km. It’s FWD too. In short, at this point in time - and out towards the end of 2020 - it looks like you’ll either need to spend a big amount of money on a premium EV to get the best range possible, or you’ll have to get used to the Model 3’s screen. You could always get an aftermarket head-up display fitted…"

You also mention the fluid being changed, it’s very important that Honda fluid is used, and you say it was when it was changed, but you don’t say what oil was in the transmission before it was changed.

        "answer": "It depends somewhat on the condition of the sand. If it’s well packed and solid all-wheel drive would suffice, but I wouldn’t rely on it on loose, deep sand. For that I would want a proper four-wheel drive."

        "question": "What four-wheel drive should I buy?",
        "answer": "The Fortuner is a tough and rugged vehicle, but it does have some shortcomings. The side-mounted third row seats is one thing we think could be done better, but it's the harshness of the suspension that gets our goat most - other SUVs in the segment (like the Ford Everest and Mitsubishi Pajero Sport, not to mention the SsangYong Rexton and Isuzu D-Max) all have better ride comfort and compliance. Further to that, Toyota still hasn't upgraded the Fortuner with advanced safety gear. The HiLux now gets AEB, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control, and so that tech should be rolled out for a 2020 update soon, too. If you plan to do more on-road driving than off-road exploring, or if safety is a high priority for you, you might be best having a look around. If you're planning to see the country and take the back way while you do, a Fortuner might be a great match for you - and the brand's unrivalled network of dealers does make it an appealing option."

        "question": "Should I buy the Toyota C-HR Hybrid of the Camry HL Hybrid?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately the C-HR Hybrid isn't yet on sale in Australia, though it is likely to be available here in 2020.If you can't wait that long, the Corolla Hybrid could be a great option for you. That is, unless you need a big back seat, a big boot or a full size spare wheel... You only get a full size spare on the top-spec ZR, which is beyond the budget, and no Corolla hatch has a big back seat or boot. There is a Corolla sedan coming in November, which will have a big boot and bigger back seat. The Camry Hybrid is a much bigger car, and offers a lot more accommodation as a result. It's a big, lovely car - one we'd wholeheartedly recommend. And you should be able to fine one under $30k less than 12 months old. Otherwise, check out the Corolla Hybrid (SX would be our recommendation), and you might even be able to get one brand new within your budget.Test drive them both, and let us know how you go!"

        "answer": "Buying for an 18-year-old male is a difficult task. What you think he should drive is probably not what he would like to have. The best approach is to buy the latest model you can afford, because that will be the safest, have the best economy, and be worth the most when you want to sell or trade it. Your budget would suggest a four-cylinder small car of around 2012/13. Something like a 2013 Toyota Corolla would get you 5-star safety, be quite economical, and relatively easy to sell later on."

The told us that their supplier has been working on a solution which they hope will be available fairly soon. It is complicated by the fact the software is not supplied only to Kia and any changes have to be cleared by all users. From that I think you could assume the Tucson is probably also affected."

If it’s been properly serviced all its life to date and you continue to service it well you should be able to keep on top of any issues that crop up. But at the same you should anticipate that problems might occur more often now, and that will involve more expense. Looking forward you need to decide if you want to gamble on it giving little or no trouble, or get out of it. If you are not sure about it get out of it now."

In the past Holden has come to the party with some or the entire repair costs, but that was some time ago when the car was near new. As yours is seven years old Holden might not be as cooperative.

But it appears to happen at random, which makes it hard for mechanics to trace and fix. It is most likely a problem with the electronics, so if it continues to occur I would suggest you sit down with the dealer and work out a plan of action to hopefully find the cause and fix it."

It comes down to negotiation between you and Hyundai. Hyundai has told you they will fix your car, and providing they do that they will have lived up to their responsibility, but I understand your concerns. I would suggest you lodge a claim with Hyundai with all the supporting information you can assemble, and trust that they will come good with a goodwill gesture that satisfies you."

        "answer": "Have the dealer let you drive a demo vehicle and see if that is the same as yours.

But it is allowed to sell a speedo that is fast, at least within a specified tolerance. It can’t simply be fixed, you have to put up with it. Presumably you have an alternative device that gives you a more accurate speed-reading and you should rely on that."

But having started negotiating with them about a fix they have recommended the touch-up guy, that’s then their responsibility and you have the choice of accepting the work done or rejecting it. By going to another panel shop you are taking responsibility for the repair and I’m not surprised that Renault would refuse any warranty on the panel and paint thereafter. Have them do the repairs, don’t get involved yourself; you are only muddying the waters."

        "answer": "You have to approach it as a car that’s more than 10 years old, one that will have normal mechanical wear and tear. Fortunately Porsche engines and gearboxes are durable and don’t unduly wear. Check for signs of a hard life; make sure the car you want to buy has been well maintained with regular servicing, and that things like brakes are not in need of immediate replacement. It’s a good idea to have a Porsche expert check it out for you."

        "answer": "Is it ‘jumpy’ every time you start it, or perhaps only when the engine is cold? If it is the latter it could be that it’s not getting the correct enrichment and that could be a temperature sensor issue on the motor.

Rev it too high and you’ll lose the effect of the diesel torque. It could simply be that, or it could be an electronic problem. Have a mechanic run a diagnostic check on it to see if there is a problem."

        "answer": "Keeping a car for the long term is always risky because there’s no guarantee that it won’t breakdown some time on the future. But you say your Honda has been regularly serviced, garaged, and hasn’t been in a crash, so if you’re prepared to keep up with the service and take good care of it there’s no reason to get out of it. On top of that 182,000 km is not a lot by today’s standards, so there’s every reason to keep it going. If you do want to switch any of the top selling small hatches should fill the bill."

        "answer": "The GQ Patrol was a tough old bird, but it’s old and buying one now is a gamble. You could consider a Toyota Landcruiser, but again your budget will limit you to an older vehicle and that is always a risk. You could perhaps consider fitting power steering to the XF ute."

        "answer": "To start you need to have the filter cleaned out by what it called a manual regeneration. It’s not a warranty issue. Take it to a Subaru dealer and get a quote from them. The reason the light has come on is that the car hasn’t been driven in a way that ensures the regeneration takes place automatically. It could be because of the way you drive it, or the way previous owners have driven it. When you talk to the Subaru dealer about regenerating the filter also ask about the way to drive it so the regeneration happens automatically."

It would be worth having it checked by a mechanic or dealer to see if there is something amiss with it. It’s hard to say what the suspension noise might be, without actually hearing it I would only be guessing. Have a suspension specialist check it for you."

It’s impossible to answer your question with any accuracy, but you have already had a good run out of the car and I wouldn’t expect that you would get another 360,000 kilometres out of it. But if it has been well serviced with regular oil and filter changes the engine could conceivably go for many years yet.

The burn-off happens automatically without you knowing it’s happening, but it needs regular freeway type driving for it to happen. If your travels don’t involve any freeway travel then the burn-off might not happen and you have to take it to a dealer to have it done manually. From what you tell us about your driving I would say it doesn’t suit a diesel, and you would be better off buying a car with a small petrol engine."

        "answer": "The DPF is supposed to automatically regenerate, but it sometimes won’t do that if the car doesn’t run at high enough speeds to generate the temperature required. That usually happens because the car is just being used for short trips and doesn’t regularly get a chance to run at higher speeds on highways or freeways. Running it at higher engine speeds in lower gears might be one way of getting the temperature up, and you could run it to 3000 rpm without any danger, but it doesn’t seem like a good way to fix the problem."

White smoke would tend to suggest a problem with the turbocharger. Turbochargers have to have clean oil to survive; dirty oil will kill them eventually. You need to negotiate with LDV, if you haven’t missed the service by a long way you might be able to get some help on the cost of repairs; otherwise you’re unlikely to get much assistance."

They won’t pay the whole cost of the repair as you have had six years of use out of the diff, and it’s now worn as a result of that use. There is no hard and fast rule that applies to your situation. The offer from Ford is based on the amount of wear and the projected life of the diff. You’re best to negotiate with Ford and hold out for the best deal you can get."

Things that can indicate a crash are a mismatch of paint between adjacent panels, overspray, do areas of the body look fresher than other areas. Bartering is just that. Work out what the car is worth and what you are prepared to pay for a car and make an offer perhaps lower than that so you’ve got some room to move if the seller makes a counter offer."

        "answer": "There’s no way to tell if the DSG gearbox will play up in the future, all you can do now is to test drive the car in as many driving situations as you can and look for anything that might suggest an underlying problem. If it drives ok I wouldn’t be concerned about it. Brakes do tend to wear out faster on European cars than cars from Asia, and parts are likely to be a little more expensive. It’s important to verify the low odometer reading, and it should have a record of regular servicing."

It’s not a good idea to miss services, particularly on cars with turbochargers. Keeping a fresh supply of oil is the key to trouble-free motoring with turbos. There’s every chance the turbo was faulty when you first noticed it, and having missed a service you probably contributed to the failure.

The batteries are said to last the lifetime of the vehicle, so there’s reason to be concerned about that either. The thing with the hybrid is the higher purchase price. That’s offset by the lower fuel consumption, so the longer you keep the vehicles the greater the chance to recoup the extra initial cost.The other thing to consider is that hybrids work at their best in stop-start city traffic, they are not so good out on country roads where the petrol engine comes into play more of the time."

First, flip the smart key over and look for the small button on the back of the key. Pop it out, then remove the small metal key inside. Looking under the driver's door-handle there is a small hole you can insert the key into, then twist and pull off the plastic housing on the end of the door handle. This shows the manual key barrel to open the car.Put the key in, turn the key and open the door. Then, pull the small tab on the rubber liner in the cupholder, and remove that liner. Place the key face up in the indent in the bottom of the rear cupholder, with the unlock button facing forward. You can now start your car like normal."

        "answer": "If you need to unlock a modern car like a Ford Edge (Endura) without a key then I hope you got good grades at Hogwarts as magic spells are the only way you'll succeed in getting into your car. However, before you grab a brick and injure yourself trying to break in, there are better alternatives (providing it isn't an emergency). Top of the bunch is to ring a qualified locksmith to come out and open the car for you for a fee. While Hollywood makes it look simple to enter a car without a key the old days of picking locks and hotwiring the ignition is pure fantasy as electronic immobilisers and modern lock designs are not simple things to beat. If a locksmith can't help you, you can have the vehicle towed to your local dealership to have it opened by them."

        "answer": "Yes, I think the dealer is doing the appropriate thing. It’s not unusual for a whole door to be replaced; it’s easier and quicker to do that than repair the door panel.

I don’t doubt the claim that the camera itself can’t be adjusted, but something has changed and what that is needs to be established so it can be fixed. Take it back to the dealer and ask them to have another look and find a solution.Sometimes dealers don’t go the extra mile to fix a problem, they can be more focussed on getting the car out the door."

There is no rule that says a car will get from one service to the next without adding some oil, and with the extended service intervals in play today it's more likely that you will have to add oil at some point before reaching the next service.

        "answer": "If you've locked your keys in your car, or lost them all together, then you are going to need to get a little creative to get back into your car. In the old days you could probably have used a ruler and some wire to pop the door lock on your car, then hotwired it and driven it away. However, vehicles built in the last 40 years (like the Dodge Nitro SUV) aren't so simple and require the professional help of a locksmith to get into. A locksmith will be able to open your car door, though if you have lost your keys completely you may still need to have the car taken to your mechanic to have the locks replaced and the new keys coded to the car's computer."

Request a meeting with your dealer’s service manager and go through the history of the problem and have them tell you what they will do to fix it.

        "answer": "Both are good cars and should give you reliable motoring for many years to come. The servicing costs are similar. The Hyundai is only three years old and has only done minimal kilometres, so should by in near-new condition if it has been looked after and well serviced.

        "answer": "Losing or locking your keys in your car is a frustrating experience which can take plenty of time and money to fix. Modern cars like the Dodge Caravan minivan are difficult to break into without smashing the window, which is dangerous as glass can cut you as it breaks and then takes a lot to clean up. While Hollywood makes it look easy to pick a car's lock and then hotwire it to drive off, the reality is modern vehicle security is complex. You should call a mobile locksmith straight away and get them to come and let you into the vehicle."

        "answer": "Chrysler products suffer from a reputation for having hit-or-miss reliability, being that some cars are fault-free gems while others are nightmares of continual issues. Dodge vehicles are no longer sold new in Australia, so I'd suggest looking to options from Kia or Toyota, as well as the Chrysler Grand Voyager if you're desperate for an American van."

But if you like it why not keep it and enjoy it? But if you do, keep it for those special days and don’t drive it daily.Remember though, you have to keep it in pristine condition and well maintained, so don’t park it and forget about it."

        "answer": "I can’t say for sure what has gone wrong with the car, a mechanic would need to assess it firsthand to be able to tell you that. But the transmission is a CVT, which can be troublesome, but it might be as simple as changing the oil, or it might be that it needs to be replaced.I wouldn’t be buying a Murano that’s done a lot of kilometres without having the transmission assessed by an expert mechanic."

        "question": "Volvo XC90 2008: Is more than 200,000km a worry?",
        "answer": "You’re right to be concerned about buying a car with a high mileage.While it’s tempting to buy a car that was once out of our financial reach now that the price has down to a point you can afford it you have to think about the future rather than the now. How long do you plan to keep it, and how many kays will it do while you own it. If you plan to keep it three years it will have close to 300,000 km when you want to sell it. You have to ask yourself if you can afford to have it repaired if something goes wrong. Volvos are no better or worse than other European cars, but like all European brands they tend to be more expensive to repair when they break down. Buying secondhand is not like buying new when all the cars are the same. All secondhand cars are different, they’ve been driven by different people, they’ve been subjected to different climates and road conditions, they’ve been serviced at varying frequencies by different service mechanics, some factory trained, some backyarders, some have done more kilometres than others, etc., etc.The best advice is to buy the best car, with the lowest odometer reading, with the best service history, that’s been owned by the fussiest owner."

        "answer": "On average a 2012/13 Wildtrak is worth $27,000-$30,000 and would have 80,000-120,000 km on the clock. For that you would expect it to be in good condition and well serviced. Yours fits into that window, but of course has an extensive array of extras that would add to its appeal, and its value. I would suggest you add up the cost of each of those extras and add about 50 per cent of that value to your asking price."
