# ðŸ›  Mech-botðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

The Mech-Bot project aims to create an intelligent chatbot that assists car owners in diagnosing and solving car-related issues. The target audience includes individual car owners and small repair shops. This chatbot will leverage the latest advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide accurate and timely assistance. Mech-Bot will be implemented using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, which combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide more precise and contextually relevant answers.

### ðŸŽ¯Scope:

The initial version of Mech-Bot will focus on diagnosing common car problems and providing maintenance tips. The chatbot will use a database of car repair manuals, which will be collected in PDF format. These manuals will serve as the primary source of information for Mech-Bot, enabling it to provide detailed and accurate responses to user queries.

### ðŸ“šðŸ”§Data to Use:
Repair Manuals: Detailed, step-by-step instructions on car maintenance and repair, available in digital formats like PDFs, and loaded using PyMuPDF.
